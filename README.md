# Pi vs. AI: Could a Neural Network Predict the Next Digit of Pi?  

## Introduction 
This project explores whether AI can predict the next digit of Pi using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network**. Since Pi is irrational and non-repeating, the experiment tests whether AI can detect a pattern.  

To validate the modelâ€™s ability to learn sequences, we also trained it on Fibonacci numbers, which follow a strict mathematical rule.  

## Dataset  

ðŸ”¹ **Pi Dataset:**  
- We used the first **100,000 digits of Pi**, available [here](https://www.angio.net/pi/digits/100000.txt).  

ðŸ”¹ **Fibonacci Dataset:**  
- Fibonacci numbers were generated dynamically.  
- Only the **last digit (MOD 10)** was used, revealing a **60-digit repeating cycle (Pisano Period 10).**  

## Models Trained  

We trained two **LSTM neural network models**:  

**Pi Model**: Trained on Piâ€™s digits to predict the next digit.  
**Fibonacci Model**: Trained on Fibonacciâ€™s digits to predict the next digit.  

Both models used sequence-based learning, where AI was fed previous digits and asked to predict the next one.  

## Results  

ðŸ“‰ **Pi Model Accuracy**: ~10% (same as random guessing)  
ðŸ“ˆ **Fibonacci Model Accuracy**: ~100% (AI learned the repeating cycle)  

AI could not learn Pi â†’ Pi has no discoverable pattern.  
AI quickly learned Fibonacci â†’ Fibonacci follows a predictable structure.

## Conclusion  

AI is powerfulâ€”but only when a pattern exists!  
- AI could not predict Pi, confirming that **Pi is truly random**.  
- AI quickly mastered Fibonacci, proving it **excels at structured sequences**.  

This experiment highlights the limits of AIâ€”it canâ€™t predict what isnâ€™t predictable.
